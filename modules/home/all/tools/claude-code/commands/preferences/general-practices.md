# General Practices

- Use git for version control and make atomic commits of individual hunks to single files
- Use conventional commit messages for semantic versioning
- Write one sentence per line in markdown, text, and documentation files
- Test changes with the relevant framework like pytest, vitest, or a task runner like `just test` or `make test` before considering any work complete and ready to git commit to the version control repository
