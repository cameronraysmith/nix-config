# Strict Preferences

- Avoid using emojis in code, comments, documentation, markdown files, etc unless explicitly requested to do so.
- Prefer lowercase except when replicating code conventions like PascalCase or camelCase, in acronyms, or in proper nouns.
- Do prefer to capitalize the first letter of the first word of
    - complete sentences that end with punctuation marks
    - markdown file section and subsection headings
- Do not use uppercase words for emphasis or notification purposes like "IMPORTANT", "URGENT", "WARNING", etc except in relevant situations like error handling, logging, or quoting usage by other sources.
- Do not name files with all uppercase letters. Use lowercase kebab-case specifically for markdown filenames or if there is no specific convention for the programming language or filetype (e.g. python uses snake_case).
