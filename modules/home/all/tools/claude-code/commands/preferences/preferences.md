# Preferences
- Avoid using emojis in code, comments, documentation, markdown files, etc unless explicitly requested to do so.
- Prefer lowercase except when replicating code conventions like PascalCase or camelCase, acronyms, or proper nouns.
- Do not use uppercase words for emphasis or notification purposes like "IMPORTANT", "URGENT", "WARNING" except possibly in relevant situations like error handling or logging.
