## Location

- Most repositories use `docs/` for their active documentation but some have
  both `docs/` and another directory like `site/`, `website/`, `nbs/`, etc.
- Most `README.md` files in the repository root should aim to include minimal
  content with relevant links to the docs website unless they do not yet have
  docs.

## Structure

Generally assume we intend to follow this standard structure for repository
documentation combining user-facing and development documentation:

```
docs/
├── tutorials/           # Diataxis: Learning-oriented lessons
├── guides/              # Diataxis: Task-oriented how-tos
├── concepts/            # Diataxis: Understanding-oriented explanations
├── reference/           # Diataxis: Information-oriented API docs (optional)
├── about/               # Contributing, conduct, links into development
└── development/         # Development documentation (adapted AMDiRE-based)
    ├── index.md         # Development overview and navigation
    ├── context/         # Context Specification (problem domain)
    │   ├── index.md     # Context overview and table of contents
    │   └── context.md   # Problem domain, stakeholders, objectives
    ├── requirements/    # Requirements Specification (problem ↔ solution bridge)
    │   ├── index.md     # Requirements overview and traceability matrix
    │   └── requirements.md  # Functional/non-functional requirements
    ├── architecture/    # System Specification (solution space)
    │   ├── index.md     # Architecture overview and table of contents
    │   └── architecture.md  # System design and component structure
    ├── traceability/    # Requirements traceability
    │   ├── index.md     # Traceability overview
    │   └── testing.md   # Test framework and validation approach
    └── work-items/      # Work packages and implementation tracking
        ├── index.md     # Work items overview and status dashboard
        ├── active/      # In-progress work items
        ├── completed/   # Finished items with PR/ADR/RFC/RFD references
        └── backlog/     # Planned but not yet started items
```

### Document evolution

Many projects will begin with only `docs/development/` and add the user docs
directories later. Initial development drafts context.md, requirements.md,
architecture.md, and testing.md as single comprehensive documents. As complexity
grows—expected for most real projects—decompose each document by major
subsection into separate files with descriptive names (e.g., context.md →
stakeholders.md, objectives.md, constraints.md). Update the corresponding
index.md to serve as table of contents and navigation after sharding. This
pattern maintains manageability while preserving traceability as documentation
scales. If the documentation becomes sufficiently complex, we can continue to
refactor into a directory tree with additional levels.

### Key principles

- Separate user documentation (diataxis framework) from development
  documentation (AMDiRE methodology)
- User docs focus on helping users learn, accomplish tasks, understand concepts,
  and find reference information
- Development docs provide traceability: context (why) → requirements (what) →
  architecture (how) → work items (implementation)
- Work items bridge planning to execution with workflow state tracking (backlog
  → active → completed)
- Maintain bidirectional traceability between requirements, architecture
  decisions, and implementation artifacts
- Reference GitHub issues, pull requests, ADRs, RFCs, or RFDs in completed work
  items for full audit trail
- Name files in the work-items directory using the pattern
  `<issue-id>-<very-short-description>.md` with zero-padded issue IDs to support
  up to four digits (e.g. GitHub issue #12 becomes `0012-description.md` in
  `work-items`).

## Code

- In code, prefer docstrings relevant to a given programming language over code comments
  as the docstrings end up in `docs/reference/` files automatically generated by
  most language API reference documentation tools.
- Only add comments to code for reference or to explain awkward or complex code,
  but prefer to include it in docstrings when possible.

## Maintenance

- Proactively review and propose to update relevant documentation, including the
  repository's active documentation directory and relevant README.md files when
  there are changes to any of the contents each references.
- Be judicious in the use of documentation, ensuring that it is clear, concise,
  and accurate for humans to read and understand.
- Propose to remove, refactor, and consolidate documentation as relevant to
  maintain optimal correspondence between the code and documentation.
