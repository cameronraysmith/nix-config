# Python Development

- Add type annotations to all public functions and classes
- Use `basedpyright` for static type checking and beartype for runtime type checking
- Create tests using `pytest` in a src/package/tests/ directory
- Use `ruff` for linting and formatting Python code
- Use src-based layout for python projects
- Add docstrings (Google style) to public functions and classes
- Use `uv run` to execute Python scripts, not `python` or `python3`
