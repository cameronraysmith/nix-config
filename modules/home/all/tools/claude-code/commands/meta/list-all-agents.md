# List All Agents

List all available agents (sub-agents) available for use from your system prompt or from local system, user, or project-level `.claude` directories. Display them in a bulleted list. For each agent, display the agent name, a hyphen, and the purpose of the agent. Use a double line break between each agent for readability.
